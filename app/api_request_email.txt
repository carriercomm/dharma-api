Hello!

So just a few words before you get stuck into the Dharma API. All of the talks
that you'll find through the API are archived by other organisations such as
dharmaseed.org and audiodharma.org and are done so with specific licences 
such as this Creative Commons License;

http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/

The API asserts the relevant license for each talk. If you're building an app
on top of the API please respect the relevent licenses and also the spirit of 
dana (generosity) that these talks were given with.

Here's your API key: #{api_key}

Sincerely,
The Happy Dharma API robot x
